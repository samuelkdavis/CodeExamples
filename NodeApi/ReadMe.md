> I wonder why so many people still keep suggesting axios as a good http library.

>For me axios is following request path and will soon be deprecated mainly because there are no maintainers ready to maintain it for "free"
> That's why as of now i've switched all my projects from axios to got because Sindresorhus is exactly the definition of an opensource maintainer and axios's maintainers are not.

> Edit : Oh and i forgot but got is the most complete http library for node from a feature pov.
